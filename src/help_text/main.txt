This app is intended to become a fully functional pomodor-style timer and 
tracker. Currently implemented: the options to start immediately or on the press
of the 's' key after running the program, as well as the ability to provide the
number of minutes for the session.

Hotkeys within the program are as follows:
'p' - play / pause the timer from the pause / play states, respectively
's' - start the timer from the unstarted state
'q' - exit the program
