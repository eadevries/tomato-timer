This app is a minimalist pomodoro-style timer and tracker. Session completion
is signified by a background color change to dark red as well as an (optional)
audio notification.

Hotkeys within the program are as follows:
'p' - play / pause the timer from the pause / play states, respectively
's' - start the timer from the unstarted state
'r' - reset a completed session
'q' - exit the program
